Tingyimiao Panda Plateform


TINGYIMIAO Panda Platform is a solution for creating a chatbot based on artificial intelligence with LLM (Large Language Model).

The objective of this solution makes the service Open Source for large companies or SMEs by facilitating the development of a chatbot that replaces usual customer service, in just a few clicks on our platform.

Our product is mainly a response to customer needs who would like to set up a Chatbot for customer service, FAQ or a search engine in the form of a chatbot. The product can also be extended to internal company needs, such as the application of LLM as an agent automatically responding to emails, scheduling an appointment or predicting business questions and the associated response.


We can offer the LLM in Open source such as (Mistral AI, Llama2 or CHATGML..) for most of our clients or even possible using chatGPT.

The first version of our solution would be available as a WordPress plugin on the Wordpress marketplace. Our client will be able to integrate the plugin without any technical skills, whether front-end, back-end or even machine learning. It is a low-code platform.

The confidentiality of our clientâ€™s company data is our priority. This is why we undertake not to keep their data without their authorization. The client is free to train LLM with the data via our platform. We guarantee the security of data flows at the time of integration via secure APIs.

We are aware that our client and we must respect the AI regulations of France and Europe. We will also train with the organization for the new AI regulations.
